============================

Two applications are included here: ObjView and ViewerES

ObjView is a Java 3D application which loads and displays a Wavefront
OBJ file, and outputs a text file of arrays and variables describing
the model. For more details, read the readme.txt file in ObjView\.

The text file arrays and variables should be pasted into a copy
of OBJShape.java, which can be found in ViewerES\src\.

ViewerES is a MIDP JOGL-ES application which shows how OBJShape
can load, position, scale, and display the model data.
For more details, read the readme.txt file in ViewerES\.
